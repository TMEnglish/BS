To clone the repository:

1. Click on the green "Clone or download" button above, on the right.
2. Copy the link to the clipboard.
3. Click on the + (plus sign) in the upper right corner of the page.
4. Select "Import repository."
5. Paste the link where requested for an old repository's URL.

To use your clone of the repository, and not my copy, you must register your clone at [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org):

1. Paste the URL of your clone where asked for a URL.
2. Copy the URL you are given.
3. Edit the README.md file, and replace the link to my binder with the link to your binder.

That is all.


Replication and critique of the numerical experiments reported in Section 5 of Basener, W.F. & Sanford, J.C. [The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-017-1190-x), J. Math. Biol. (2017).

This repository is a binder of Jupyter notebooks. If you want simply to view the notebooks, click on the `.ipynb` links above. (Note that GitHub sporadically fails to display notebooks.) If you want to work with the binder on a JupyterHub server, then click on the icon below, and wait patiently for the configuration of a virtual machine to complete.

Thanks to [MyBinder.org](MyBinder.org) for providing this excellent service free of charge. Don't blame their server for the slow launch of the binder, which contains a large volume of data.

Thanks also to William Basener for granting me permission to reuse the code for [Realistic Mutation-Selection Modeling](https://people.rit.edu/wfbsma/evolutionary%20dynamics/EvolutionaryModel.html), some of which is included in `BS.js`. Basener retains the copyrights, and has not issued a public license.
